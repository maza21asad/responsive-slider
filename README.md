# Responsive Slider

The **Responsive Slider** project is a React-based web application that utilizes the Swiper library to create a responsive slider for displaying pictures. This slider allows users to navigate through a collection of images seamlessly, providing a visually engaging experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Vite**: Vite is used as the build tool for this project. It offers fast development server, instant hot module replacement (HMR), and efficient production builds.
- **React**: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is used to create the components and manage the application's UI.
- **Swiper**: Swiper is a modern mobile touch slider library. It provides a powerful set of APIs for creating various types of sliders and carousels. In this project, the Swiper React wrapper (`Swiper` and `SwiperSlide` components) is used to implement the responsive slider functionality.
- **Ionicons**: Ionicons is a set of beautifully crafted open-source icons. It is used to incorporate icons for navigation controls in the slider.
